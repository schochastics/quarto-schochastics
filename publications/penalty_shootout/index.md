## Abstract 
We compare conversion rates of association football (soccer) penalties during
regulation or extra time with those during shootouts. Our data consists of
roughly 50,000 penalties from the eleven~most recent seasons in European men's
football competitions. About one third of the penalties are from more than 1,500
penalty shootouts. We find that shootout conversion rates are significantly
lower, and attribute this to worse performance of shooters rather than better
performance of goalkeepers. We also find that, statistically, there is no
advantage for either team in the usual alternating shooting order. These main
findings are complemented by a number of more detailed analyses.
