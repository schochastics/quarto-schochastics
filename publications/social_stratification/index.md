## Abstract 
Social networks can be made of various kinds of ties, but (often implicit) assumptions embodied in network-analytic tools do not necessarily apply to all of them. Centrality indices,  or instance, build on the assumption that it is always beneficial to add more ties. While it has been noted that networks of ties with a negative sentiment require different concepts of centrality, we here highlight ties that are neither positive nor negative to have, but an indication of commonality. This is exemplified by the derivation of socio-economic status from networks that indicate common class membership.
