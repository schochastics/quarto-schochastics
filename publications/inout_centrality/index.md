## Abstract

Centrality indices such as β-centrality, Katz status, and Hubbell’s
index are commonly generalized to directed networks by relating the
in-centrality of nodes to the in-centrality of their in-neighbors and
equivalently so for out-centrality. This paper proposes an extension
of Bonacich’s β-centrality and related measures for directed networks
where the in-centrality of a node depends on the out-centrality of their
in-neighbors and their out-centrality on the in-centrality of their out-
neighbors. The so defined indices extend hubs and authorities in the
same way as β-centrality generalizes eigenvector centrality. Several
technical results are presented including the extension of the range of
permissible β parameters to negative values, similar to traditional β-
centrality.
