## Abstract 
Network analysis usually deals with relations among entities which are positive, such as
friendship, or advice seeking. Most analytic tools are constructed with this assumption, be that
centrality indices, or clustering tools. However, not all conceivable relationships are positive.
People can be friends but also enemies. A signed network is a network where both, positive
and negative relationships may occur. Common network analytic tools are not applicable to
such networks without adapting for the existence of negative ties. The R package signnet
brings together methods that have been developed to analyze signed networks. This includes
known blockmodeling techniques, centrality indices and tools for two-mode networks, as well
as unique analytic techniques surrounding structural balance theory.
