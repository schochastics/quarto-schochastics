## Abstract 
Network analysis offers a powerful set of methods to understand the relationships among
entities, such as people, or organizations, and the patterns that emerge from these connections.
It is increasingly popular in various fields, including sociology, biology, economics, and computer
science, and has been used to study diverse phenomena including the spread of diseases, flow
of information, and the structure of political organizations. Network visualization is a powerful
tool for exploring, analyzing, and communicating network structures and patterns therein.
However, in contrast to tabular data, nodes can technically be placed arbitrarily on the plane
and it is easy to draw wrong conclusion based on an inadequate layout. To circumvent arbitrary
placement of nodes, many different layout algorithms have been developed which optimize
different stylistic features and can serve purposes in communicating structural properties. The
package graphlayouts implements several state-of-the-art algorithms which are so far not
available for R. This includes algorithms for large graphs, to emphasize hidden group structures,
and important nodes within a network.
