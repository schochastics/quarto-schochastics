## Abstract 
In the last decade, replication and reproducibility crises have shaken the
scientific landscape. As potential solutions, open science practices were
heavily discussed and have been implemented with varying success in different
disciplines. We argue, however, that the binary definition of reproducibility,
specifically for computational-X disciplines such as computational social
science, is insufficient since it is not explicit about the agents and
conditions under which results can be reproduced. We expand the definition to
avoid "open washing", the practice of fabricating theoretical reproducibility
but not supporting practical or verified reproducibility, and introduce a tier
system of computational reproducibility based on the concept of verifiability.
We identify common barriers to verifiable computational reproducibility,
specifically in the field of computational social science, and provide
suggestions on how to circumvent common access and computational barriers.
