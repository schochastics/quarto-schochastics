<div class="habout">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I&rsquo;m  David Schoch</div>

<div class="lead">

I'm the **team lead** for "Transparent Social Analytics" in the Department for Computational Social Science at [GESIS](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science) and 
  I develop tools in [R](https://r-project.org/).

## more about me

Before joining GESIS, I was a Presidential Fellow at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) in the [Department of Sociology](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/sociology/), affiliated with the [The Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/mitchell-centre/). 

I received my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/) as a fellow of the [Graduate School of Decision Sciences](https://www.gsds.uni-konstanz.de/). I also have a diploma in business mathematics from 
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/).

## research interests

My main research interests lie in the field of (social) network analysis. I have made technical and methodological 
contributions to topics such as network centrality, signed networks, and two-mode networks.

I am also actively involved in research around political astroturfing on social media. 

See [my publications](/publications/) for all my scientific output.

## worldclubratings

In an effort to combine a hobby with work, I created the football analytics website [worldclubratings](http://worldclubratings.com/) together with some former colleagues.
The project includes a world ranking of football clubs, close to the one FIFA uses for [national teams](https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/men?dateId=id13505). I developed most of my data science and R skills
with this project, including scraping and cleaning data (i.e. collecting football results from various sources) and using the tidyverse to analyse the data. 

Part of the data is available on [github](https://github.com/schochastics/football-data).


## science slam
I am a semi-active Science slammer, mostly slamming about networks and
disinformation on social media. Some of my slams can be found on youtube (all in german).
