The network can be exported as an igraph object at the end of the session by clicking on \"Done\".\n\nThe third addin `Netreader` is meant to facilitated the import of raw network data. It provides a GUI to easily\nread network and attribute data and combine them to an igraph object. The underlying code of the import procedure\nis shown at the end. This should help users to learn importing data themselves.  \n\nThe fourth addin `Componentlayouter` allows to layout networks with several components manually by placing them on an empty\ncanvas. Components can also be rotated and resized. After finishing the session, the layout is saved as x and y vertex attributes.\n\n## Quick look at the SNAhelper\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/snahelper.gif)\n\nCode to reproduce the used network.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(igraph)\nurl <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evelinag/StarWars-social-network/master/networks/starwars-full-interactions-allCharacters.json\"\ndf <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url)\n\ndf$nodes$id <- 1:nrow(df$nodes)\ndf$nodes$display <- df$nodes$name\ndf$nodes$name <- df$nodes$id-1\ng <- graph_from_data_frame(df$links,directed = F,vertices = df$nodes)\n\nV(g)$name <- V(g)$display\n\ng <- remove.vertex.attribute(g,\"id\")\ng <- remove.vertex.attribute(g,\"display\")\ng <- delete.vertices(g,which(degree(g)==0))\n\nV(g)$display <- ifelse(V(g)$value>75,V(g)$name,\"\")\nV(g)$colour <- ifelse(V(g)$display==\"\",NA,V(g)$display)\n\ng\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Quick look at the Netreader\n\n`Netreader` should be pretty selfexplanatory. The first two tabs allow you to import\nraw data (edges and attributes). Make sure to specify file delimiters, etc. according to the shown preview.\n\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/Netreader1.png)\n\nUsing the `Netreader` should comes with a learning effect (hopefully). The last tab shows the R code\nto produce the network with the chosen data **without** using the Addin. \n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/Netreader2.png)\n\nThe network will be saved in your global environment once you click \"Done\".\n\n## Quick look at the Netbuilder\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/Netbuilder.gif)\n\n## Quick look at the Componentlayouter\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/Componentlayouter.gif)\n\nHighlight an igraph object in your script and selcet the `Componentlayouter` from the RStudio addin menu.\nComponents are added by clicking on the canvas and can be resized/rotated and re-positioned using the buttons at the \nbottom. The final layout is stored as x and y coordinates in the igraph object.\n\n## Installation\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# developer version\n#install.packages(remotes)\nremotes::install_github(\"schochastics/snahelper\")\n\n#CRAN version\ninstall.packages(\"snahelper\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo work properly, you also need [graphlayouts](https://github.com/schochastics/graphlayouts), which adds new\nlayout algorithms.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"graphlayouts\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Usage of SNAhelper\n\nTo use the main addin, simply highlight a network in your script and select \n`SNAhelper` from the Addin dropdown menu.\n\n## Interface\n\n### Layout\n\nThe layout tab allows you to choose from all implemented algorithms in `igraph` and\nsome layouts from `graphlayouts`. The default is a stress based layout and also the recommended choice.\nIn the tweak section you can move individual nodes around. Choose the node from\nthe dropdown menu and click on its new position in the plot.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/layout.png)\n\n### Node Attribute Manager\n\nThe Node Attribute Manager shows all existing node attributes in a sortable table.\nIn addition, you can calculate some new ones (centrality and clustering). \nThe functions automatically choose the right version of indices, depending if\nthe network is directed/weighted/undirected/unweighted.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/NattributeMan.png)\n\n### Nodes\n\nThis is where you can style your nodes. You can either do it manually, by choosing a\ncolor/size for all nodes together, or based on an attribute.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/nodes.png)\n\n### Edge Attribute Manager\n\nSame as Node Attribute Manager but for edges. So far only shows existing edge attributes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/EattributeMan.png)\n\n### Edges\n\nYou can style your edges here. `snahelper` automatically detects if your network\nis directed and adds arrows if the network is directed. The other options are similar to the nodes tab.\nThe snahelper automatically chooses the appropriate edge geom. If multiple edges are present, it uses\n`geom_edge_parallel0()`. Otherwise `geom_edge_link0()`.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/edges.png)\n\n### Result\n\nThe result tab shows the network in its full size. If you are satisfied with the results, hit\nthe Done button and the R code to produce the plot is automatically inserted in your script.\nOr you can directly save the result as a png file.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/result.png)",
