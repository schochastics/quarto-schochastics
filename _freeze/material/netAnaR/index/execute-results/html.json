The last section of this tutorial is devoted to this topic in great detail. \n\nThe tutorial does introduce key terms for network analysis, but much of the theory behind them is not explained in great detail. This tutorial is meant to be \"hands-on\", giving practical help for empirical \nwork. If you are interested in the technical/theoretical details behind certain methods, please consult \nrelevant literature (a list is given at the end of the tutorial).\n\n# Required libraries\n\nTo run all the code in this tutorial, you need to install and load three packages.\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/install_libraries_8d96f59eea0356903bd8c504511aae4a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"igraph\",\"netrankr\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"schochastics/networkdata\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n`igraph` is used for the majority of analytic tasks and for its data structures. `netrankr` is a package\nfor network centrality. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(netrankr)\nlibrary(networkdata)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/silent_libraries_d6afceaf50d9a1a1fdbea004b30a4fa1'}\n\n:::\n\n\nMake sure you have at least the version given below.

Two other packages \nthat allow for this are `graph` and `network`. The former is, however, not available on CRAN anymore, only via\nBioconductor. The latter provides the foundation for much of the statistical modelling aspects for networks such as\nExponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SAOMs).\n\nThe figure below shows how many packages on CRAN rely on those three packages (i.e. they are mentioned in `Depends`, `Imports`, or `Suggests`).\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/crannet_depend_fbb1548adbf91cb4892b5a87402c6abc'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/crannet_depend-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe figure was produced with the help of the `cranet` package ([link](https://github.com/mbojan/cranet)).\n`igraph` seems to be clearly favored by the R community. So if you install a package for, say, signed network analysis,\nchanges are high that it depends on the graph structures provided by `igraph`. Besides the data structures,\nthe package offers a large variety of network analytic methods which are all implemented in C. The methods are well optimized and\nalso work quite well for large graphs. \n\nThe `network` package historically shares some commonalities with `igraphs` data structures. The package itself, though is really only providing the data structure and no analytic methods. The `sna` package ([link](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sna)) implements network analytic tools using the data structures provided by `network`.\nOverall, the syntax and provided methods are very much comparable between `igraph` and `sna` and they are almost interchangeable in this regard. The advantage of igraph is its speed. I have run several benchmark tasks and `igraph` usually comes out on top. That being said, there is no real case to be made against `network`/`sna`. If you are into statistical modelling of networks, then that should actually be the preferred choice since the `ergm` package is build on top of `network`. In this case you probably also\nwant to look at the meta package `statnet` ([link](http://statnet.org/)) which includes `network`, `sna`, and `ergm` (among other packages).\n\nThe package `intergraph` ([link](https://cran.r-project.org/package=intergraph)) can be used if you need to switch representations between `igraph` and `network`.\n\n\n---\n\n# Basic network notations\n\nNetworks are commonly represented with an **adjacency matrix** or via an **edgelist**. If you are interested \nin a \"tidy way\" checkout my [tidygraph](../tidynetAnaR/) tutorial. Below, we represent friendship relations between Bob, Ann, and Steve as a matrix and an edgelist.\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/simple_struc_12f757fffe3227aca3a098b4eba43f24'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# adjacency matrix\nA <- matrix(c(0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0),nrow = 3,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)\nrownames(A) <- colnames(A) <- c(\"Bob\",\"Ann\",\"Steve\")\nA\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Bob Ann Steve\nBob     0   1     1\nAnn     1   0     1\nSteve   1   1     0\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#edge list\nel <- matrix(c(\"Bob\",\"Ann\",\"Bob\",\"Steve\",\"Ann\",\"Steve\"),\n             nrow = 3,ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)\nel\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     [,1]  [,2]   \n[1,] \"Bob\" \"Ann\"  \n[2,] \"Bob\" \"Steve\"\n[3,] \"Ann\" \"Steve\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe adjacency matrix $A$ is symmetric, meaning that the relations are undirected, i.e. Bob is friends with\nAnn and Ann is friends with Bob. In general, $A[i,j]=1$, if there is a relation between $i$ and $j$.\nIf $A[i,j]=1$ does not imply $A[j,i]=1$ then $A$ defines a directed network.\n\nOnce we have defined an edgelist or an adjacency matrix, we can turn them into `igraph` objects\nas follows.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/simple_graph_9fa69fdbcf2713900372714380d97705'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng1 <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A, mode = \"undirected\", diag = FALSE)\ng2 <- graph_from_edgelist(el,directed = FALSE)\n#g1 and g2 are the same graph so only printing g1\ng1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nIGRAPH 792b086 UN-- 3 3 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c)\n+ edges from 792b086 (vertex names):\n[1] Bob--Ann   Bob--Steve Ann--Steve\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe printed summary shows some general descriptives of the graph.\nThe string \"UN--\" in the first line indicates that the network is *U*ndirected (*D* for directed graphs) and has a *N*ame attribute (we named the nodes Bob, Ann, and Steve). The third and forth character are *W*, if there is a edge weight attribute, and *B* if the network is bipartite (there exists a node attribute \"type\"). The following number indicate the number of nodes and edges.\nThe second line lists all graph, node and edge variables. Here, we only have a node attribute \"name\". \n\nThe conversion from edgelist/adjacency matrix into an igraph object is quite straightforward. The only difficulty is setting the parameters correctly (Is the network directed or not?), especially for edgelists where it may not immediately be obvious if the network is directed or not.\n\nIn the following, we use a larger network to introduce some terminology.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/load_greys_ae6011bb0e8a61f8c41ef3685c1a0d7a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"greys\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/plot_greys_a543f65699ea5c317fe90e0b656bff96'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_greys-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe \"greys\" network is part of the `networkdata` package and consists of most characters from the \nshow \"Grey's Anatomy\" and who hooked up with whom.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/print_greys_703d58d4beae13df3c9c65ae3693d69e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngreys\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nIGRAPH f7716f1 UN-- 54 57 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), sex (v/c), race (v/c), birthyear (v/n), position\n| (v/c), season (v/n), sign (v/c)\n+ edges from f7716f1 (vertex names):\n [1] Arizona Robbins--Leah Murphy     Alex Karev     --Leah Murphy    \n [3] Arizona Robbins--Lauren Boswell  Arizona Robbins--Callie Torres  \n [5] Erica Hahn     --Callie Torres   Alex Karev     --Callie Torres  \n [7] Mark Sloan     --Callie Torres   George O'Malley--Callie Torres  \n [9] Izzie Stevens  --George O'Malley Meredith Grey  --George O'Malley\n[11] Denny Duqutte  --Izzie Stevens   Izzie Stevens  --Alex Karev     \n[13] Derek Sheperd  --Meredith Grey   Preston Burke  --Cristina Yang  \n+ ... omitted several edges\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Descriptives and more notations\n\nThe **density** of a network is defined as the fraction of the potential edges in a network that are actually present.\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/density_959732d302ec7c2b24d9f44167e942b3'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(graph.density(graph.empty(10)),\n  graph.density(greys),\n  graph.density(graph.full(10)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.0000000 0.0398323 1.0000000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe density of an empty network is $0$ and for the full network it is $1$.

Triads are labelled `xyzL` where `x` is the number of reciprocated ties, `y` is the number of unreciprocated ties and `z` is the number of null ties.

The network below shows an example for a network with a visible and intuitive cluster structure.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/clustered_graph_58046d190a40e3811e4bc9fea4c141ad'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/clustered_graph-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn contrast, the network below does not really seem to have any well defined cluster structure.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/random_graph_cafcf3c5ea81b37fc67167d44ffaec98'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/random_graph-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe following algorithms for graph clustering are implemented in `igraph`.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/cluster_alg_15285762a217d8b0efeecf0eed45f64a'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"cluster_edge_betweenness\"  \"cluster_fast_greedy\"      \n [3] \"cluster_fluid_communities\" \"cluster_infomap\"          \n [5] \"cluster_label_prop\"        \"cluster_leading_eigen\"    \n [7] \"cluster_leiden\"            \"cluster_louvain\"          \n [9] \"cluster_optimal\"           \"cluster_spinglass\"        \n[11] \"cluster_walktrap\"         \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMost of these algorithms are based on \"modularity maximization\".

An introduction to the package can be\nfound on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12779).\n\n</details>\n\n## ... signed networks\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Expand</summary>\n\nTraditional SNA usually deals with relations among entities (e.g. people) that are positive, including “friendship”, “advice seeking”, etc. Most network analytic tools are devised under this premise, be that centrality indices, clustering tools and so forth. But of course not all occurring relations are positive. People can be friends but also foes.\n\nThis gives rise to signed networks. These networks are usually composed of both, positive and negative, ties measured among a set of entities. Traditional network analytic tools are not applicable to such networks without adapting for the presents of negative ties. The `signnet` package ([link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=signnet)) brings together methods that have been developed to analyse signed networks. This includes\n\n- Structural balance ([tutorial](http://signnet.schochastics.net/articles/structural_balance.html))\n- Blockmodeling ([tutorial](http://signnet.schochastics.net/articles/blockmodeling.html))\n- Centrality ([tutorial](http://signnet.schochastics.net/articles/centrality.html))\n- Signed two-mode networks ([tutorial](http://signnet.schochastics.net/articles/signed_2mode.html))\n\nA dedicated tutorial for each methodology is given in the package vignettes, also linked above. Below, we\njust briefly discuss the structure of the package.\n\nThe foundation of `signnet` is provided by `igraph`. All functions in the package \nassume that an igraph object is a signed network if it has an edge attribute “sign” with values 1 (positive) or -1 (negative).\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/signed_example_4957922e915e31de1fa1a5e4d8c35bf1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(signnet)\ng <- graph.full(5,directed = FALSE,loops = FALSE)\nE(g)$sign <- 1\ng\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nIGRAPH d5a26e9 U--- 5 10 -- Full graph\n+ attr: name (g/c), loops (g/l), sign (e/n)\n+ edges from d5a26e9:\n [1] 1--2 1--3 1--4 1--5 2--3 2--4 2--5 3--4 3--5 4--5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAll methods should throw an error if the sign attribute is missing or contains other values than -1 and 1.\n\nMatrices associated with a signed network follow the `igraph` naming scheme. The signed adjacency matrix can be obtained with `as_adj_signed()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/signed_adj_c4c5986f9885dc1afbe1d81df5b731a1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"tribes\")\nas_adj_signed(tribes)[1:5,1:5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Gavev Kotun Ove Alika Nagam\nGavev     0     1  -1    -1    -1\nKotun     1     0  -1     0    -1\nOve      -1    -1   0     1     0\nAlika    -1     0   1     0     0\nNagam    -1    -1   0     0     0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe signed Laplacian matrix is obtained by `laplacian_matrix_signed()`.\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/signed_lapl_36ac44178ac26646ebf6c821ecc3735e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlaplacian_matrix_signed(tribes)[1:5,1:5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Gavev Kotun Ove Alika Nagam\nGavev     8    -1   1     1     1\nKotun    -1     8   1     0     1\nOve       1     1   6    -1     0\nAlika     1     0  -1     3     0\nNagam     1     1   0     0     7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA function not explicitly mentioned in the tutorials linked above is `triad_census_signed()` which calculates the\nsigned triad census of a directed signed network. While the unsigned triad census has only 16 possible outcomes, there are 138 non-isomorphic signed triads, shown below.\n![](signed_triads.png)\nThe naming scheme is \"xxx-yyyyyy\" where \"xxx\" corresponds to the name of the respective unsigned triad and \"yyyyyy\" is \na string of \"0\", \"N\", \"P\", describing the type of ties present. So \"300-NNNNNN\" is a triad with all ties present and all ties are negative. \n\nThe package includes two well known datasets to play with.\n\nThe “tribes” dataset is a signed social network of tribes of the Gahuku–Gama alliance structure of the Eastern Central Highlands of New Guinea. The network contains sixteen tribes connected by friendship (“rova”) and enmity (“hina”).\n\nThe “cowList” dataset contains a list of 52 signed networks of inter-state relations over time (1946-1999). Two countries are connected by a positive tie if they form an alliance or have a peace treaty. A negative tie exists between countries who are at war or in other kinds of conflicts. The dataset is derrived from the [correlates of war](https://correlatesofwar.org/).\n\n</details>\n\n## ... ego networks\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Expand</summary>\n\nIf you want to analyze ego networks, then I can only recommend this\n[book](http://www.raffaelevacca.com/egocentric-r-book/) by [Raffaele Vacca](http://www.raffaelevacca.com/).\nRaffaele has given countless workshops on ego network analysis in R and his material should provide\nyou with everything you need.\n\n</details>\n\n## ... multilevel networks\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Expand</summary>\n\nFor analyzing multilevel networks, I recommend the `multinet` pakage ([link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multinets)).\nCheck out this [JSS Paper](http://multilayer.it.uu.se/jss.pdf) for a brief introduction into the package.\n\nIf you just want to visualize a multilevel network, then head over to my [network visualization](../netvizr/#multilevel-networks) tutorial.\n\n</details>\n\n## ... multigraphs\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Expand</summary>\n\nMultigraphs are network representations in which multiple edges and edge loops (self edges) are permitted.\nIn R, there are at least two relevant packages. The first is `multigraph` ([link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multigraph)) which implements some visualization methods for \nmultigraphs.\n\nThe second is `multigraphr` ([link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multigraphr)) which comes with a\nseries of statistical methods to study local and global properties of such graphs and goodness of fit tests.\nThe [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multigraphr/vignettes/multigraphr.html) of the package is\na brilliant starting point for using the package.\n\nFor the technical details behind `multigraphr`, you can refer to:\n\n>Shafie, T.

Ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/schochastics) and I see what I can do.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n# Loading network data into R\n\n`igraph` can deal with many different foreign network formats with the function `read_graph`.\n(The `rgexf` package can be used to import Gephi files.)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/read_graph_24fd8fd775454283c7ec7aa49e1f3f94'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread_graph(file, format = c(\"edgelist\", \"pajek\", \"ncol\", \"lgl\",\n  \"graphml\", \"dimacs\", \"graphdb\", \"gml\", \"dl\"), ...)\n```\n:::\n\n\n(*I personally have encountered some issue when importing `graphml` files that were \nproduced in [visone](https://visone.ethz.ch/html/about.html). Also `dl` files sometimes through an error.*)\n\nIf your network data is in one of the above formats you will find it easy to import\nyour network. \n\nIf your data is not in a network file format, you will need one of the following functions to turn raw network data into an `igraph` object:\n`graph_from_edgelist()`, `graph_from_adjacency_matrix()`, `graph_from_adj_list()`, or\n`graph_from_data_frame()`.\n\nBefore using these functions, however, you still need to get the raw data into R. The concrete procedure\ndepends on the file format. If your data is stored as an excel spreadsheet, you need additional packages.\nIf you are familiar with the `tidyverse`, you can use the `readxl` package. Other options are, e.g. the `xlsx` package.\n\nMost network data you'll find is in a plain text format (csv or tsv), either as an edgelist or adjacency matrix.\nTo read in such data, you can use base R's `read.table()`.\n\nMake sure you check the following before trying to load a file: Does it contain a header (e.g. row/column names of an adjacency matrix)? How are values delimited (comma, whitespace or tab)? This is important to set the parameters `header`, `sep` to read the data properly.\n\n\nIf you are struggling with this step, you can use the `Netreader` Rstudio add in which comes with the `snahelper` package\n\n![](Netreader1.png)\nUsing the `Netreader` should comes with a learning effect (hopefully). The last tab shows the R code to produce the network with the chosen data without using the Addin.\n\n![](Netreader2.png)\n\nSince the addin is supposed to be very general, the code might look a bit awkward.\nThe functions `graph_from_edgelist()` and `graph_from_adjacency_matrix()` come with a drawback. You can't add node or edge attributes automatically. \n\nIn general, it is always a good idea to organize network data in two different data frames. One for the nodes (with attributes)\nand one for the edges (edgelist+attributes). This will save you a lot of pain when trying to convert the \ndata into an igraph object. Especially if you want to go down the [tidy way](../tidynetanar/) later.\n\n\n\n# What is missing?\n\nI have tried to cover as many of the available packages and tools to analyze networks in R as possible \nand will include more details (and packages) over time. What I will probably never cover though are \npackages related to network dynamics, such as `ergm` or `Rsiena`. These are just not my 🍵. \nFor `ergm`, you can refer to this [statnet tutorial](http://statnet.org/Workshops/ergm_tutorial.html) and for \n`Rsiena` you can check out the [Rsiena webpage](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/siena_scripts.htm).\n\n---\n\n# Further Reading\n\n\n\n\n",
