description: Implements methods for centrality related analyses of networks. 
    While the package includes the possibility to build more than 20 indices, 
    its main focus lies on index-free assessment of centrality via partial 
    rankings obtained by neighborhood-inclusion or positional dominance. These 
    partial rankings can be analyzed with different methods, including 
    probabilistic methods like computing expected node ranks and relative 
    rank probabilitie.
