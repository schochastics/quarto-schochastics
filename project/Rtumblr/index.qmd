## Installation

You can install the development version of Rtumblr like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("schochastics/Rtumblr")
```

## API keys

You need to register an app here: <https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps>
Then, create an environment variable called “RTUMBLR_TOKEN” (for
instance in `.Renviron`) from the consumer_key and the consumer_secret
as follows. If you have

``` r
consumer_key = 123456789
consumer_secret = abcdefghi
```

Then your environment variable RTUMBLR_TOKEN should be
`123456789;abcdefghi`

## Usage

Most API endpoints only work with your own account. The ones already
implemented include:

- `get_blog_blocks()`: get a list of accounts you blocked
- `get_blog_likes()`: get a list of posts you liked
- `get_blog_followers()`: get your followers
- `get_blog_following()`: get accounts you follow

Implemented endpoints that work with any account are:

- `get_blog_avatar()`: get the avatar of a blog
- `get_blog_info()`: get the general info of a blog
- `get_blog_posts()`: get the posts of a blog
- `get_posts_tag()`: get posts with a specific tag.

All function return a tibble (or list of tibble). To get information
about columns, see the official API documentation:
