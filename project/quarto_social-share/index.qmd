## Installing

```
$ quarto install extension schochastics/quarto-social-share
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using
Add the following to the yaml header of your document. You can set options to `false`
if you don't want to display the respective share button.
```
share:
  permalink: "https://mr.schochastics.net/"
  description: "awesome page"
  twitter: true
  facebook: true
  reddit: true
  stumble: true
  tumblr: true
  linkedin: true
  email: true
```

`permalink` is the url you are going to share and `description` and optional text.
